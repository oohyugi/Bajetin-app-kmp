## **Architecture for Bajetin**

Bajetin is built with a Hybrid Architecture, combining:
- **Feature-based modularity**: Each feature, such as "Transaction History" or "Budget Management," is self-contained.
- **Shared logic and components**: Shared utilities, themes, and data models ensure consistency and reduce duplication.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The app follows the MVVM architectural pattern

### Core Folder
The `core` folder contains shared logic that can be used across features:
- **`domain/`**: Contains reusable use cases and entities that encapsulate business logic.
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility classes, helpers, or extensions.

### Data Folder
The `data` folder contains:
- **`repository/`**: Centralized repositories managing data from different sources (local or remote).
- **`local/`**: Handles database-related operations (e.g., DAO for Room).
- **`remote/`**: Manages API calls or network interactions.
- **`model/`**: Shared data models used across the application.

### Features Folder
Each feature has its own modular folder, containing:
- **`data/`**: Feature-specific data.
- **`domain/`**: Feature-specific use cases and entity.
- **`presentation/`**: UI-related components like ViewModels and Screen.
